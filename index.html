								<br><b>Echo Location: Distances to Galactic Supernovae From ASAS-SN Light Echoes and 3D Dust Maps</b><br>
								Light echoes occur when light from a luminous transient is scattered by dust back into our line of sight with a time delay due to the extra propagation distance. We introduce a novel approach to estimating the distance to a source by combining light echoes with recent three-dimensional dust maps. We identify light echoes from the historical supernovae Cassiopeia A and Tycho’s SN in nearly a decade of imaging from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). Using these light echoes, we find distances of 3.6 ± 0.1 kpc and 3.2<sup>+0.1</sup><sub>-0.2</sub> kpc to Cas A and Tycho, respectively, which are generally consistent with previous estimates but are more precise. These distance uncertainties are primarily dominated by the low distance resolution of the 3D dust maps, which will likely improve in the future. The candidate single degenerate explosion donor stars B and G in Tycho are clearly foreground stars. Finally, the inferred reddening towards each SN agrees well with the intervening H I column density estimates from X-ray analyses of the remnants.

								<!--The Condor Array Telescope is an astronomical research telescope built, concieved, and managed by a small project team at Stony Brook University. 
								The Project is funded by the Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation Program of the National Science Foundation. This is a six telescope array located in the Rio Hurtado Valley of Chile each outfitted with large format CMOS cameras.
								-->
								This catalog contains data on almost 1500 supernovae and their host galaxies. 
								Due to the nature of the ASAS-SN telescopes, this catalog focuses on spectroscopically confirmed supernova with brightnesses above 18th magnitude in the g-band.
								Supernovae discovered by ASAS-SN and supernova discovered by other groups are included, and we label whether we independently recovered externally discovered supenovae from ASAS-SN photometry.
								This catalog is meant to allow for large statistical analyses utilizing both these supernova and those from the previous four catalogs for a total sample of 2427 bright supernovae.
